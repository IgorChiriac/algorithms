# Algorithms implemented in the master thesis project

The following algorithms were implemented during the master thesis project. Differential Evolution is a 
powerful heuristic algorithm used to solve single objective optimization problems. Based on its success the GDE3 algorithm
was developed which is suited to solve multi objective optimization problems. SHADE algorithm try to solve the problem of
selecting the parameter control for DE algorithm and self-adapt the parameter control value during the optimization process
based on the results at each generation.
